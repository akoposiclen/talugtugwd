				<p class='indent'>Connection will be made upon approval and all basic charges are paid. The customer assumes responsibility for the meter and all water that passes through the connection.  The Service connection will apply only to the premises, building or establishment mentioned on the application. Property owner /concessionaire shall be held liable for two or more sub-connection under the application. Our policy is one water meter for every application.</p>

In cases where the installation shall exceed standard fittings, costs of additional labor and/or materials shall be paid by the customer in addition to his down payment. The customer will conform to the rules and regulations of the District and shall sign contract agreement under this payment scheme.</p>
